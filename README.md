# 50002-16bitALU

The Arithmetic Logic Unit does the mathetical boolean operations given operands by the control unit in the CPU. The ALU is also part of the CPU. After taking in operands(inputs from the control unit) and calculating, the ALU returns the calculated results to the respective registers(control unit memory elements) in the control unit. The control unit then writes these values to the respective addresses in the memory unit outside the CPU.
